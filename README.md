This is an android application that will send to wekinator 3 values (floats)
with device orientation (x, y, z).

You can get the .apk (compiled android app) here: 
https://github.com/omarcostahamido/Android_Feature_Extractor/releases/download/v0.1-beta/Android_Feature_Extractor.apk
Alternatively, you can compile it yourself if you can work your way around Processing.
You will need oscP5 and Ketai libraries, as well as android mode for Processing. 
Here is the source code: https://github.com/omarcostahamido/Android_Feature_Extractor

After installing application and openning it you need: 

1. to enter the IP of the computer where you are running Wekinator (I only tested with both devices under the same network).
2. press "enter" or "return"
3. now open wekinator on your computer and setup a project that is receiving 3 inputs.
4. just pat yourself on back, you were #flawless!

Tips: change your android device's screen light duration to prevent it from going to sleep.

Limitations: if you make a mistake entering your IP number you need to restart app. There
is no delete here, you need to be #flawless ;)

If you need help or you want to work with me to turn this app #1 on the Play Store, my
contacts are at the top of this document.
